            <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap" Text="As you begin sketching out your character's background, consider the general status level of the character's previous life.  Did they come from squalor and poverty?  Did they live a comfortable life?  Were they destined for a greater position later on?  Even something as simple as 'my character was a formerly wealthy heir to a noble family' provides a wealth of ideas on which to build their backstory and help determine both starting Obligation and Motivation.  Backgrounds are not mechanical aspects of development.  Instead, they are thematic facets of a character that help define them as more than a set of numbers.  Players do not need to give a background, but their characters are likely to be far more interesting with them." />
